MyML

(Yet Another) Machine Learning library in Python by Javier Arriero-Pais

The primary intention of this library is my better understanding of algorithms
that learn from data and the improvement of my Python skills.

Secondary goals of this project are integration of the techniques implemented
here into the broadly-used, well-developed Sklearn and having a collection of
not-so-standard methods in ML such as unsupervised method, with special
emphasis on Kernel methods.
